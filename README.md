## Patient Readmission Prediction
This project focuses on building a predictive model to identify patients at risk of readmission, enabling healthcare providers to intervene and provide appropriate care to reduce readmission rates. The model is built using Python, scikit-learn, and Faker for simulating patient data. This README provides an overview of the project structure, data generation, and model building process.

## Introduction
Patient readmission is a critical concern in healthcare, and predicting which patients are at risk can help healthcare providers take proactive measures to reduce readmission rates. This project uses a RandomForestClassifier to predict whether a patient is likely to be readmitted based on simulated patient data.

## Project Structure
- data_generation.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for generating simulated patient data using the Faker library.
- patient_readmission_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for building and evaluating the predictive model.
- README.md: The document you are currently reading, providing an overview of the project.
- Data Generation
- The data_generation.ipynb notebook generates simulated patient data using the Faker library. The generated data includes features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes status, smoking status, and readmission status.

## Model Building
The patient_readmission_prediction.ipynb notebook builds a predictive model using the RandomForestClassifier from scikit-learn. The model is trained on the simulated patient data, and its performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Usage
- Open and run the data_generation.ipynb notebook to generate simulated patient data.
- Open and run the patient_readmission_prediction.ipynb notebook to build and evaluate the predictive model.
- Note: Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the provided !pip install commands.
